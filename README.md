Description: An analytical project that uses Pandas to explore demographic data extracted from the 1994 Census database. 
This project answers key questions about the dataset, such as the distribution of race, education levels, income brackets, and working hours. 
The analysis includes calculating statistics like the average age of men, the percentage of people
earning more than 50K based on education level, and identifying trends in working hours and income.
